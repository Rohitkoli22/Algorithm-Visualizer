#How to run the project

#Download the all Files
#Save it in Single folder
#Open the folder using code editor
#run the main.py file 

#Project Details

#The mainy.py is starting point of the project we run the main.py file for execution of project
#The App.py file has all design content and tkinter library which is used for the graph bar and front end design
#The algorithm folder contains all the algorithm code used in project
#Images are used to set the background of project and as button logo

#Project Purpose
• System is developed to encourage a practical learning process, and facilitate 
better communication between students and instructors. 
• This system helps to understand the differences and relations of algorithm 
solving the same or similar problem. Algorithm Visualizer helps to learn how 
algorithm and data structure work. 
• This system illustrates how algorithm works in graphical way. It mainly aims to 
simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithm operations. 
• The windows-based application is developed using Python and tkinter Library
